# Nerdle Desktop App
[Nerdle](https://warm-brushlands-11373.herokuapp.com "Game LandingPage")

## This app uses React, CSS for its front end. The back-end uses express, node.js, and mongoDB/mongoose for it's database.

## Deployed through Heroku

### This game is essentially a desktop version of New-York-Times game "wordle" but it's nerd themed. It functions as such: The page will have a randomized designated solution (a specific word) each time you load the page. These words are either Marvel Comic, DC Comic or Lord of the Rings themed.Type 5 letters into the boxes to guess what word you may think the solution is and hit enter to confirm the guess. If you want to change the guess before you confirm it, you may backspace the letters. If a letter turns green upon confirming, that means it is placed in the correct location. If the letter turns yellow, that means the word does contain that letter, but not in that location. If the letter is grey, that means the word does not contain that letter. The colors that appear in the guess-boxes will be reflected in the keypad below. You have six attempts to guess the correct word before you either win or lose.
